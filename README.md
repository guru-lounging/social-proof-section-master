### Continued development

This particular challenge was difficult, however I found that it pushed me forwards in using CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. 

Alongside that, I designed this challenge with the mobile site in mind first, before transitioning to the desktop site. That being said, I wrote the HTML initially for the desktop site, which allowed me to then think about the two different structures and layouts together, and my source HTML was designed in a way to accomodate both layouts.
